## Known Security Features

The following security features are implemented and maintained in the project:

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `apiToken` Authentication | All remote endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <apiToken>` when a token is configured; comparison uses `crypto.timingSafeEqual` | ✅ Implemented |
| `policyEpoch` Memory Governance | Bumping `policyEpoch` downgrades all prior `dream_runs` to historical evidence; their receipts no longer drive real-time memory decisions | ✅ Implemented |
| `conflictFreezeEnabled` Conflict Freeze | Conflicting memories are not auto-merged; they are flagged as pending human review, preserving data integrity | ✅ Implemented |
| CAS (Compare-and-Swap) Guard | Prevents concurrent write conflicts; ensures atomic write operations | ✅ Implemented |
| Digest Baseline Audit | Memory updates are compared against digest baselines to detect unauthorized changes | ✅ Implemented |
| `failure_memories` Audit Trail | Every failed write operation is logged for forensic analysis | ✅ Implemented |
| `recall_run` Search Audit | Every search operation is recorded with timestamp and query metadata | ✅ Implemented |
| Local-First Data Processing | All embeddings, reranking, and memory consolidation run locally; no data leaves the device | ✅ Implemented |
| No Telemetry | No analytics, no remote logging, no network requests by design | ✅ Implemented |
| Query Sanitization | LIKE-query escaping, bounded paging, and Markdown mirror escaping prevent injection and malformed input | ✅ Implemented |
| `entityExtractionEnabled` Opt-In Entity Extraction | Entity extraction is opt-in via configuration (default: off), minimizing data processing by default | ✅ Implemented |
| Graceful Degradation | System falls back to keyword search on component failure; no crash | ✅ Implemented |
| Human-Editable Mirrors | All memories mirrored to Markdown files; users can verify and reconstruct data | ✅ Implemented |
| Mirror Generation CAS/Fence | Mirror sync is bound to a monotonic `generation` counter with CAS/fence semantics; stale or concurrent mirror writes are rejected | ✅ Implemented |
| Crash-Recovery Debt Model | Business writes atomically bump `desired generation` in the same transaction; after a crash, `recoverMirror` replays the debt instead of silently skipping repairs | ✅ Implemented |
| `/health` Auth-Gated Endpoint | Health endpoint requires `apiToken`; error codes are sanitized (no-space / permission / sync-failed) and read failures fail closed as `unknown` | ✅ Implemented |
| Fail-Closed Input Validation | Generation counters and hot-memory parameters are validated (`Number.isInteger`, finite, non-negative) with SQL `CHECK` constraints; invalid input falls back to safe defaults or is rejected | ✅ Implemented |
| Hybrid Score Clamping | Hybrid fusion scores are clamped to [0, 1] to prevent vector + BM25 stacking from breaking normalization bounds | ✅ Implemented |
| Standalone External API (v0.7.12, opt-in) | Optional per-plugin HTTP server for ecosystem integrations, bound to `127.0.0.1` by default with an auto-generated persistent Bearer token (`timingSafeEqual` verified); `/health` is the only unauthenticated route; binding a non-loopback host is an explicit operator decision | Implemented |
| Tag Sanitization | Tag normalization reuses the sanitizer; `autoTag` skips forgotten memories; `setMemoryTags` runs inside a SAVEPOINT for atomic rollback | ✅ Implemented |

### Standalone External API (v0.7.12)

Since v0.7.12 the plugin can optionally start its own HTTP server (`externalApiEnabled`, default **off**) so other plugins, CLIs, and desktop tools can read and write memories without going through the DSH host port.

- **Loopback by default**: the server binds `127.0.0.1:8790` (`externalApiHost` / `externalApiPort`, or persisted panel settings). Rebinding to a non-loopback address exposes the store to your network and is an explicit operator decision.
- **Token authentication**: every route except `GET /health` requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; the token is auto-generated on first use, persisted in the plugin settings store, verified with `timingSafeEqual`, and can be rotated from the web panel (Settings -> External API).
- **Surface**: read/write on memories only (`GET/POST/DELETE /memories`, `GET /memories/:id`, `GET /search`, `GET /status`). No profile, rules, commands, or configuration endpoints are exposed; writes go through the same dedupe + quality-filter path as in-conversation saves.
- **CLI**: `bin/cli.mjs` is a thin client over this API and stores its credentials in `~/.dsh-mneme/cli.json` - treat that file like any credential file.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Please DO NOT

- Open a public issue for security vulnerabilities
- Post exploit details in discussions or comments
- Submit PRs that expose security flaws without prior coordination

### Please DO

1. **Email** `work@modusensus.space` (or open a **private security advisory** via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/slow-stack/dsh-mneme/security/advisories))
2. Include:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce (minimal test case preferred)
   - Impact assessment (data exposure? local-only? remote?)
   - Affected versions
   - Your proposed fix (if any)
   - Whether you are requesting credit / disclosure preferences

### Scope and Out of Scope

**In scope** — issues this policy covers:
- Remote API authentication or authorization bypass (`apiToken`-protected surfaces)
- Memory integrity violations (CAS/fence bypass, unauthorized overwrite, replay paths)
- Mirror consistency and recovery logic that can cause silent data corruption
- Exploitable vulnerabilities in shipped runtime dependencies (supported versions only)

**Out of scope** — we will not act on:
- Social engineering or phishing against maintainers or users
- DoS claims that require unrealistic local resource exhaustion with no product defect
- Vulnerabilities present only in unsupported versions (`< 0.7.0`)
- Best-practice hardening suggestions with no demonstrable security impact

Not sure whether your finding is in scope? Report it anyway via the private channel — we will triage and respond.

### Response Timeline

| Phase | Time | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Acknowledgment | Within 48 hours | We confirm receipt and assign a tracking ID |
| Initial Assessment | Within 7 days | We validate severity and scope; we may request additional information |
| Fix Development | Severity-dependent | Critical: ≤ 14 days; High: ≤ 30 days; Medium/Low: next release |
| Validation & Testing | 1–3 days after fix | We run regression and security tests on the patch |
| Coordinated Disclosure | At fix release | We publish a security advisory and release patch simultaneously |

**Note**: For Critical vulnerabilities, if a full fix cannot be developed within 14 days, we will provide a temporary mitigation or workaround within that timeframe.

### Escalation (If You Do Not Hear Back)

- If you do not receive an acknowledgment within **48 hours**, re-send to `work@modusensus.space` with subject prefix: `[SECURITY][FOLLOW-UP]`.
- If there is still no response after another **48 hours**, open a **private security advisory** via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/slow-stack/dsh-mneme/security/advisories) and reference your original report timestamp.
- Do not disclose details publicly while escalation is in progress.

### Severity Classification

We follow the [CVSS v3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/specification-document) standard:

- **Critical** (9.0–10.0): Remote code execution, unauthorized data exfiltration, bypass of core security controls
- **High** (7.0–8.9): Local privilege escalation, significant data integrity compromise, DoS with high impact
- **Medium** (4.0–6.9): Information disclosure under specific conditions, partial bypass of controls
- **Low** (0.1–3.9): Minor information leakage, defense-in-depth improvements

---

## Security Design Principles

### 1. Local-First, Zero-Network

- All embeddings, reranking, and memory consolidation run locally
- Memory text **never** leaves the device
- No telemetry, no analytics, no remote logging

### 2. Fail-Safe by Default

- Any component failure (LLM, embedder, reranker) degrades gracefully to keyword search
- Malformed input never crashes the plugin or corrupts the database
- Concurrent write conflicts are resolved via CAS (compare-and-swap) guards

### 3. Audit Everything

- Every `autoDream` run generates a cryptographically verifiable receipt
- Every memory update creates a `failure_memories` audit trail
- Every search records a `recall_run` for later inspection

### 4. Human Sovereignty

- All memories are mirrored to human-editable Markdown files
- Machine writes vs. human edits are distinguished via digest baselines
- Users can fully reconstruct the database from Markdown mirrors alone

### 5. Minimal Remote Surface

- Remote API endpoints are opt-in: they require a configured `apiToken`
- When a token is set, every remote request is checked with a timing-safe comparison
- When no token is set, remote endpoints are effectively disabled; all processing stays local

---

## Dependency Vulnerability Handling

### Process

We follow a 5-step process for handling third-party dependency vulnerabilities:

| Step | Action | Timeframe | Tooling |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Scan | Continuous automated scanning of all runtime and development dependencies | Automated (daily) | OrbisAI Security, npm audit |
| 2. Assess | For each detected vulnerability, assess severity, exploitability, and impact on dsh-mneme | Within 48 hours of detection | CVSS v3.1, manual code analysis |
| 3. Report | Document findings in the security tracker; report to maintainers | Immediately after assessment | Security tracker, maintainer channel |
| 4. Fix | Upgrade dependency to a patched version or apply mitigation | Critical: ≤ 14 days; High: ≤ 30 days; Medium/Low: next release | npm/pnpm update, manual patching |
| 5. Disclose | Publish security advisory with details and fixed version | At release of fixed version | GitHub Security Advisories + npm release notes |

### Third-Party Dependency Policy

- All new runtime dependencies must pass a security review before inclusion
- Dependencies with known critical vulnerabilities that cannot be fixed within the timeline will be replaced with alternatives
- Dependency lockfiles (`package-lock.json`) are committed and reviewed in PRs

### Recent Dependency Fixes

| CVE | Package | Version (Before) | Version (After) | Severity | Fixed In |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CVE-2026-39244 | `adm-zip` | 0.5.18 | 0.6.0 | High | v0.3.4 |

| Finding | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `autoTag` could tag forgotten memories | **Medium** | ✅ Fixed (filter `forgotten` before tagging) |
| Tag normalization bypassed the sanitizer | **Medium** | ✅ Fixed (reuse `sanitize` in `normalizeTags`) |
| `setMemoryTags` not atomic on failure | **Medium** | ✅ Fixed (SAVEPOINT rollback) |

### Ongoing

- Automated dependency scanning via **OrbisAI Security**
- Community security reviews welcome via private advisory

## Security Advisory Channels

Security advisories are published through the following channels simultaneously:

1. **[GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/slow-stack/dsh-mneme/security/advisories)** — primary channel with detailed technical information
2. **[npm Releases](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modusensus/dsh-mneme)** — release notes include security advisories and fix summaries

To receive security notifications:
- **GitHub**: Watch the repository and enable "Security alerts" in repository settings
- **npm**: Subscribe to package release notifications for `@modusensus/dsh-mneme`

---

## Disclosure Policy

We practice **coordinated disclosure**:

1. Reporter submits vulnerability privately
2. We investigate and acknowledge within 48 hours
3. We develop fix and prepare advisory (timeline based on severity)
4. We notify reporter of fix timeline and planned disclosure date
5. We release patch + publish advisory simultaneously
6. We credit the reporter (with their consent) in the advisory

We do **not** pursue legal action against security researchers who:
- Act in good faith
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond proof-of-concept
- Do not access data belonging to others
- Allow reasonable time for us to respond before public disclosure

**Bug Bounty Policy**: This project does not currently offer monetary rewards. We provide public credit in the advisory (with the reporter's consent).

---

## Security Logs & Data Retention

All audit data is stored **locally** in the plugin database and never leaves the device:

| Data Type | Storage Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `failure_memories` audit logs | Local database | Every failed write is recorded; used for forensic analysis |
| `recall_run` search logs | Local database | Every search is recorded with timestamp and query metadata |
| AutoDream receipts | Local database + Markdown mirror | Cryptographically verifiable; persist until user deletes them |
| Dependency scan reports | OrbisAI Security dashboard | Not stored on device |

Retention is user-controlled: audit records live only as long as the local database does. There is no remote logging and no telemetry.

---

## Contributor Security Guidelines

All contributors must comply with the following security requirements:

1. **Dependency Audit**: Run `npm audit` before submitting a PR; newly introduced dependencies must pass security review
2. **Secret Scanning**: Never commit API keys, tokens, or credentials to the repository
3. **Input Validation**: All user inputs must be validated and sanitized (including LLM-derived content)
4. **Secure Code Review**: PRs with security-relevant changes require approval from a maintainer with security expertise
5. **Documentation**: New features must include a security impact analysis in the PR description
6. **Responsible Disclosure**: Security vulnerabilities found during development must be reported via the appropriate channel, not in public PRs

### 无响应升级路径

- 若 **48 小时内**未收到确认，请重新发送到 `work@modusensus.space`，邮件标题加前缀：`[SECURITY][FOLLOW-UP]`。
- 若再次等待 **48 小时**仍无回复，请通过 [GitHub 私有安全公告](https://github.com/slow-stack/dsh-mneme/security/advisories) 提交，并注明首次报告时间。
- 升级处理中请勿公开披露漏洞细节。

### 严重程度分级

我们遵循 [CVSS v3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/specification-document) 标准：

- **严重** (9.0–10.0)：远程代码执行、未授权数据外泄、核心安全控制绕过
- **高** (7.0–8.9)：本地权限提升、重大数据完整性破坏、高影响 DoS
- **中** (4.0–6.9)：特定条件下的信息泄露、部分控制绕过
- **低** (0.1–3.9)：轻微信息泄露、纵深防御改进

---

## 安全设计原则

### 1. 本地优先，零网络

- 所有 embedding、rerank、记忆整理均在本地运行
- 记忆文本**永不**离开设备
- 无遥测、无分析、无远程日志

### 2. 默认 Fail-Safe

- 任何组件故障（LLM、embedder、reranker）均优雅降级到关键词搜索
- 畸形输入不会导致插件崩溃或数据库损坏
- 并发写入冲突通过 CAS（比较并交换）守卫解决

### 3. 全面审计

- 每次 `autoDream` 运行生成密码学可验证的 receipt
- 每次记忆更新创建 `failure_memories` 审计轨迹
- 每次搜索记录 `recall_run` 供后续检查

### 4. 人类主权

- 所有记忆镜像到人类可编辑的 Markdown 文件
- 机器写入 vs 人工编辑通过 digest 基线区分
- 用户可仅凭 Markdown 镜像完整重建数据库

### 5. 最小远程暴露面

- 远程 API 端点为可选：需配置 `apiToken` 才生效
- 配置 token 后，每个远程请求均经过 timing-safe 比较
- 未配置 token 时，远程端点实际处于禁用状态，所有处理均在本地

## 依赖漏洞处理

### 处理流程

我们采用 5 步流程处理第三方依赖漏洞：

| 步骤 | 行动 | 时间要求 | 工具 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. 扫描 | 对所有运行时和开发依赖进行持续自动扫描 | 自动（每日） | OrbisAI Security、npm audit |
| 2. 评估 | 对每个检测到的漏洞评估严重程度、可利用性和对 dsh-mneme 的影响 | 检测后 48 小时内 | CVSS v3.1、人工代码分析 |
| 3. 上报 | 将发现记录到安全追踪器，并上报给维护者 | 评估后立即 | 安全追踪器、维护者通道 |
| 4. 修复 | 升级依赖至已修复版本或应用缓解措施 | 严重：≤ 14 天；高：≤ 30 天；中/低：下个版本 | npm/pnpm 更新、手动补丁 |
| 5. 披露 | 发布包含详情和已修复版本的安全公告 | 修复版本发布时 | GitHub Security Advisories + npm 发布说明 |

### 第三方依赖政策

- 所有新增运行时依赖需通过安全审查后方可引入
- 存在已知严重漏洞且在期限内无法修复的依赖将被替换为替代方案
- 依赖锁文件（`package-lock.json`）已提交并在 PR 中审查

## 安全日志与数据保留

所有审计数据**本地**存储于插件数据库，不离开设备：

| 数据类型 | 存储位置 | 说明 |
|---|---|---|
| `failure_memories` 审计日志 | 本地数据库 | 每次写入失败均记录，供取证分析 |
| `recall_run` 搜索日志 | 本地数据库 | 每次搜索均记录时间戳和查询元数据 |
| AutoDream receipts | 本地数据库 + Markdown 镜像 | 密码学可验证；保留至用户删除 |
| 依赖扫描报告 | OrbisAI Security 控制台 | 不存储于设备 |

保留期由用户控制：审计记录仅随本地数据库存续。无远程日志、无遥测。

```yaml
# 加固配置示例（键均对应 src/config.js 实际配置，除注明外）
dsh-mneme:
  # 如需完全手动控制，可禁用 autoDream
  autoDream: false

  # 敏感环境启用冲突冻结
  conflictFreezeEnabled: true

  # 仅使用本地 embedding（无网络）
  embedProvider: local

  # 远程端点需 Authorization: Bearer <apiToken>（timing-safe）
  apiToken: "set-a-strong-unique-token"

  # 提升以将先前的 dream_runs 降级为历史证据
  policyEpoch: 1

  # 实体抽取默认关闭（数据最小化）
  entityExtractionEnabled: false

  # Rerank 为 opt-in（默认关闭）——未启用时不下载额外模型
  rerankEnabled: false

  # 编码记忆蒸馏默认关闭（数据最小化）
  codingRetrospect: false

  # 不需要会话级清理时可关闭会话生命周期
  sessionLifecycleEnabled: false

  # 不需要后台维护时可关闭 Sleep Mode
  sleepModeEnabled: false

  # 记忆可信度加权为 opt-in（默认关闭）
  trustEpistemicWeighting: false

  # LLM 审计日志保留天数
  llmAudit:
    enabled: true
    retentionDays: 90
